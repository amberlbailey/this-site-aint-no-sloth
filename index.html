      <p>Sloths are mammals classified in the families <span class="italic">Megalonychidae</span> (two-toed sloths) and <span class="italic"> Bradypodidae</span> (three-toed sloths), including six extant species. They are named after the capital sin of sloth because they seem lazy and slow at first glance; however, their usual idleness is due to metabolic adaptions for conserving energy.</p>
      <p>Aside from their surpriaing speed during emergency flights from predator, other notable traits of sloths include their strong body and their ability to host symbiotic algae on their furs. </p>

      <p>They are classified in the order Pilosa because they are related to anteaters, which sport a similar set of specialized claws. Extinct sloth species include many megafaunal ground sloths, some of which attained the size of elephants, as well as a few species of marine sloths. Extant sloths are medium-sized arboreal (tree-dwelling) residents of the jungles of Central and South America.</p>
      <p>Sloths make good habitats for other organisms, and a single sloth may be home to moths, beetles, cockroaches, fungi, ciliates, and algae.</p>
